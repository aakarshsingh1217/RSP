- Stack is an ordered collection of elems. where elems.
are only added/removed from same end.
- In real world, e.g. of a stack would be a stack of
plates in kitchen - you add/remove plates from top of
pile.
- In software, good e.g. of stack is history of current
browser tab.
  - Let's say you're on site A and click a link to go to
  site B, then from B you go to site C, everytime you 
  click a link, you're adding to stack and your history
  is [A, B, C].
  - When you click back arrow, you're removing from stack
  , click once and you have [A, B].
- Term for stacks is LIFO (last in, first out), because
last (most recent) elem. placed inside is first elem.
to come out.

- Stacks're simple to implement.
- In python, you can just use a list stack = [] and use
stack.append(elem) or stack.pop().
- Inserting into stack is called pushing and removing
from stack is called popping.
- Can also peek (looking at elem. on top of stack).

- Time complexitry of stack opers. is dependent on
implementation.
- With dynamic arr., time complexity of opers. is
same as that of a dynamic arr. (O(1) push, pop and
random access, and O(n) search).
- Stack can also be implemented with a LL w/ a tail
ptr.

- Characteristic that makes something a stack is that
you can only add & remove elems. from same end, doesn't
matter how you implem. it, a "stack" is just an abstract
interf.
- Stacks and recursion are very similar, becaause recursion
is done using a stack.
- Func. calls are pushed on a stack, call at top of stack
at any given moment is 'active' call, on a ret. statement
or end of func. being reached, curr. call is popped off
stack.

- For alg. problems, stack is good option whenever you
see LIFO pattern.
- Usually, there'll be some component of the problem
that involves elems. in the input interacting w/ each
other.
- Interacting could mean matching elems. together,
querying some property i.e. "how far's the next largest
elem." etc.
- Sometimes LIFO property hard to see.
