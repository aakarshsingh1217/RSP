- Monotonic: (of a func or quantity) varying in such
a way that it either never decr. or never incr.

- A monotonic stack/queue is one whose elems. are
always sorted.
- Can either be sorted ascending or descending.
- Monotonic stacks & queues maintain their sorted
property by removing elems. that would violate the
property before adding new elems.
- E.g., lets say you had a monotonically incr. 
stack, current stack = [1, 5, 8, 15, 23].
- You want to push 14 onto stack, to maintain sorted
propr., need to first pop 15 and 23 before pushing 14,
after push we have stack = [1, 5, 8, 14].

- Pseudocode for maintaining a monotic incr. stack
over an input arr:

Given an integer array nums

stack = []
for num in nums:
    while stack.length > 0 AND stack.top >= num:
        stack.pop()
    // Between the above and below lines, do some logic depending on the problem
    stack.push(num)

- Before we push a num onto stack, we first check if
monotonic property would be violated, and pop elems.
until it won't be.

- Depsite nested loop, time compl. is still O(n), where
n is length of arr., because inner while loop can only
iter. over each elem. once across all for loop iters.,
making for loop iters. amortized O(1).

- Monotonic stacks/queues useful in probs. that, for each
elem., involves finding "next" elem. based on some
criteria, e.g., next greater elem.
- Also good for when you have a dynamic window of elems.
and want to maintain knowledge of max or min elem. as
window changes.
