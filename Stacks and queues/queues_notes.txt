- Queue follows FIFO pattern (first in first out).
- Elems. are added and removed from opposite sides.

- E.g. of a queue in real world is a fast food line,
people leave line when they finish ordering (from 
the front) and people enter line from back (opposite
ends).
- E.g. of queue in software is any system that handles
jobs first come, first serve basis.

- Queues trickier to implem. than stacks if you want
to maintain good performance.
- Like stack, could use dynamic arr., but opers. at
front of array (adding or removal) are O(n), where
n is size of array.
- Adding to queue is called enqueue and deletions
called dequeue, if you want them to be O(1) you
need more sophisticated implem.

- One way to implement an efficient queue is by
using doubly LL.
- W/ a doubly LL, if you have pointer to a node,
you can add or del. at that location in O(1).
- A doubly LL that maintains pointers to head and tail
(both ends w/ sentinel nodes) can implem. an efficient
queue.

- Also a data struct. called a deque, short for
double-ended queue.
- In a deque, you can add or delete elems. from both
ends, while a normal queue designated adding to
one end and deleting from other end.

- For alg. probs., queue less common then stacks,
but can be used for BFS.
