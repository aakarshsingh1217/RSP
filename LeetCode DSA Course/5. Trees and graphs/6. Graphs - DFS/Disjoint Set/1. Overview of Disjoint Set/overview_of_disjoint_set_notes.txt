- Given the vertices and edges between them, how could we
quickly check whether 2 vertices're connected?
- E.g, this figure shows edges between vertices, so how can
we efficiently check if 0 is connected to 3, 1 is connected
to 5, or 7 is connected to 8?:

- Figure (r signifies root):
-   0r       4r     5r ← 6
  ↗  ↖       ↑      ↑
  1   2       8      7
  ↑
  3       9r ← (lone node)

- We can use the "disjoint set" data struct., also known as the
"union-find" DS.

- Primary use of disjoint sets is to address connectivity b/w.
components of a network.
- The "network" here can be a comp. network or a social network.
- E.g. we can use a disjoint set to determine if two people
share a common ancestor.

Terminologies
*************

- Parent node: the direct parent node of a vertex.
  - E.g., in the figure above, the parent node of vert. 3 is
  1, the parent node of vert 2 is 0, parent of 9 is 9.
- Root node: a root without a parent node, it can be viewed as
the parent node of itself.
  - E.g., in the figure above, root node of vert. 3 and 2 is
  0, as for 0 it is its own root node, same as 9 being
  root and parent node of itself.

************************************************
The two important functions of a “disjoint set.”
************************************************

- find func. finds the root node of a given vert., in above
figure, output of find func. for vert. 3 is 0.
- union func. unions two verticfes and makes their root
nodes the same.
  - In figure above, if we union vert. 4 and 5, their root
  node'll be the same, which means union func. will modify
  root node of vert. 4 or vert. 5 to the same root node.

*************************************************
There are two ways to implement a “disjoint set”.
*************************************************

- Implement. with Quick Find:
  - In this case, time compl. of find func. is O(1), however,
  union func. takes more time w/ time compl. O(N).
- Implement. with Quick Union:
  - Compared with quick find implem., time compl. of union
  func. is better.
  - Meanwhile, find func. will take more time in this case.
