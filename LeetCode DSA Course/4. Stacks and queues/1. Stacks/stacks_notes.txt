- Another term used to descr. stacks is LIFO, stands for last in,
first out.
- Last (most recent) elem. placed inside is first elem.
to come out.

- Inserting into a stack called pushing and removing from a stack
called popping.
- Also peek oper., which means looking at elem. at top of stack.

- If stack implem. using dynamic arr., time compl. of opers. is
same as dynamic arr.
  - O(1) push, pop and random access and O(n) search.
- Sometimes stack implemented w/ a linked list w/ a tail pointer.

- Stack is a good option when you can recognize LIFO pattern.
- Usually, some component of the prob. that involves elems.
in input interacting w/ each other.
- Interacting could mean matching elems. together, querying some
prop. such as "how far is next largest elem.", eval. a math oper.
given as a str., just comparing elems. against each other, or 
any other abstract interaction.
- LIFO prop. sometimes hard to see.
