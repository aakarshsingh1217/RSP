Nodes and graphs
****************

- Trees & graphs're abstract data structs. that show up in real
and software world.

- A node is an abstract data type that stores two things: data
(anything you want - int, bool, hash map etc.) and pointers to
other nodes.

- A graph is a collection of nodes and their pointers to other
nodes.
- LLs and trees are both types of graphs.

- Even though tree is a type of graph, trees and graphs are
considered diff. topics when it comes to alg. problems.

- Nodes of a graph are called vertices, and pointers that
connect them are called edges.
- Nodes/vertices repr. with circles and edges are lines/
arrows that connect circles.

***************
What is a tree?
***************

- Like a LL, a tree is a type of graph.
- Start of a LL is called a head, start of binary tree is called
the root.

- In a LL, a node's pointer points to next node.
- In tree, node has pointers to its children.
- If node A is pointing to node B, then B is a child of A, and A 
is the parent of B.
- Root is only node that has no parent.
- In a tree, node cannot have more than one parent.

- In a binary tree, all nodes have a max. of two children.
- These children referred to as left and right child.

- Binary tree is just a collection of nodes, every node has
between 0 to 2 children, and every node except root has
exactly one parent.
- E.g.:
      3
     / \
    5  1
   /\  /\
   6 2 0 8
    / \
    7 4
- Node with val. 3 is root node, every node has exactly one
parent and at most 2 children, 6 is left child of 5 and 4 is
right child of 2.

- Trees (not just binary trees) all around us irl, e.g.:
  - File systems
  - Comment thread on app like Reddit/Twitter

- In these e.g., the root notes and children would be:
  - Root dir., and subfolders/files.
  - Original post/tweet, and comments & replies.

- If we modeled a company as a tree, each person is a node
and an edge exists from A to B if A manages B.
- CEO would be at root because they're at top of company 
and aren't managed by any other employee.
- Lets say CEO has 6 direct reports - people in C-Suite (CFO,
COO etc.).
- This means CEO has 6 children, which also means it's not
binary tree.
- Each of people in C-Suite will have people reporting to them,
like VPs, etc. etc.

- Important characteristics of company that makes it a tree
are that each pers. only has 1 manager (parent), and the
entire tree is connected (if you start at anyone and
continously trace their managers, you'll always end up at the
CEO).

****************
Tree terminology
****************

- Root node is node at top of tree.
- Every node in tree is accessible starting from root node.
- In most tree qns., the root of the tree will be given as 
input, just like how in linked lists, head was given as input.

- If you have node A with edge to node B, so A -> B, A is parent
of node B, and B is child of node A.

- If node has no children, it's called leaf node (leaf nodes
are leaves of the tree).

- Depth of a node is how far it is from root note.
- Root has depth 0, and every child has a depth of
parentsDepth + 1, so root's children have a depth of 1, their
children have a depth of 2, etc.

- A subtree of a tree is a node and all its descendants.
- Trees are recursive - you can treat a substree as if was its
own tree with the chosen node being the root.
- Using company e.g. again, entire company is repr. by a tree
rooted at CEO.
- But what if we only cared about engineering dept.?
- Let's say CTO has dir. report who's a SVP of eng., and all
engineers are under this person.
- Take this SVP and seperate them from rest of company (remove
their connection to CTO) and what're you left with?
- It's still valid tree, but now SVP is root!
- Subtree now repr. eng. dept. instead of entire company.
- Fundamental idea: you can take any given node and treat it
as its own tree, allowing you to solve problems in recursive
manner.

- E.g.:
      3_____
     /| \   |
    5 | 1   |
   /\ | /\  |
   6 2| 0 8 |
      -------
    / \
    7 4
- Enclosed in box is subtree rooted at node with val. 1 (Can be
called right subtree of node with val. 3 (the root)).
- Note that this subtree is a binary tree itself.

*******************
Code representation
*******************

- class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left, right):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

- In binary tree probs., you'll be given reference to root of
binary tree as input.
- Can access root's left subtree with root.left and right 
subtree with root.right.
- Like LL, each node also carries a value val as data.
- In a LL, the tail (last node) has its next pointer as None.
- In a binary tree, if a node doesn't have a left child, then
node.left is None, & vice-versa w/ the right child.
- If both children are None, then node is a leaf.
