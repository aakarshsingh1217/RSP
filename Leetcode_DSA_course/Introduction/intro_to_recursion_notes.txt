- Recursion is implemented using a function
that calls itself
- opposite of recursive alg is iterative alg
- print nums 1 to 10:

function fn(i):
    if i > 10:
        return

    print(i)
    fn(i + 1)
    return

fn(1)

- func needs a base case (if i > 10) to make 
recursion stop, base cases are conditions at 
start of recursive func that terminates calls.
- after fn(10), fn(11) called, but base case
triggered with empty return and goes all
the way back to fn(1) until alg terminates
- In recursion, calls cascade ontop of each
other, pseudocode example:

function fn(i):
1.  if i > 3:
2.    return

3.  print(i)
4.  fn(i + 1)
5.  print(f"End of call where i = {i}")
6.  return

fn(1)

- If you ran this code, you would see the 
following in the output:

// 1
// 2
// 3
// End of call where i = 3
// End of call where i = 2
// End of call where i = 1

- fn(4) triggers the base case, which returns. 
We are now back in the function call where i = 3 
and line 4 has finished, so we move to the line 5 
which prints "End of call where i = 3"
- every func call exists until it returns, when
moving to new func call, old one waits till it
returns, order in which calls happens is
remembered
- func call has its own local scope, f(3) call
means there's 3 versions of i simultaneously

**********************
Breaking problems down
**********************

- Fibonacci nums are seq of nums starting w/ 0,
1, then each num defined as sum of two previous
nums (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ...)
- Called recurrence relation, Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
- Pseudocode to return nth fibonacci num (0 
indexed), which needs base cases F(0) = 0 and
F(1) = 1:

function F(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    oneBack = F(n - 1)
    twoBack = F(n - 2)
    return oneBack + twoBack

- If you called F(3):

oneBack = F(2)
    oneBack = F(1)
        F(1) = 1
    twoBack = F(0)
        F(0) = 0
    F(2) = oneBack + twoBack = 1
twoBack = F(1)
    F(1) = 1
F(3) = oneBack + twoBack = 2

- F(3) broken down into two smaller subproblems - 
F(2) and F(1) through combining recurrence rel
and base cases
