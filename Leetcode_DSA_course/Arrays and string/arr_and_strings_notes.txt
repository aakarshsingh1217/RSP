| Operation                    | Array/List | String (Immutable)  |
|------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| Appending to end             | O(1)*      | O(n)                |
| Popping from end             | O(1)       | O(n)                |
| Insertion (not from end)     | O(n)       | O(n)                |
| Deletion (not from end)      | O(n)       | O(n)                |
| Modifying an element         | O(1)       | O(n)                |
| Random access                | O(1)       | O(1)                |
| Checking if element exists   | O(n)       | O(n)                |

| Why |
|-----|
- Arrays/lists usually have extra capacity, so appending just writes
to the next slot (amortized). Strings are immutable, so a new string 
of length n+1 must be created and copied.
  - amortized O(1) (occasionally resizing costs O(n), but averaged 
    out, e.g. lets say list reserved size is 8 elems and it doubles
    when space runs out, and you want to push 50 elems, first 8 elems
    is O(1), 9th triggers reallocation and 8 copies, followed by O(1)
    push, etc. etc., all pushes have O(1) compl, O(1) copies and O(n)
    realloc, this is a geom series and asymptotically equals O(n),
    therefore whole oper of pushing n obj onto list is O(n), amortized
    per elem is O(n) / n = O(1))
- Arrays/lists just decrement size. Strings must create a new string 
missing the last character, copying all n−1 characters.
- Arrays/lists must shift elements to make space. Strings must copy 
all characters into a new string with the insertion.
- Arrays/lists shift elements left to fill the gap. Strings must copy 
everything except the deleted character.
- Arrays/lists allow direct overwrite at an index. Strings can’t be 
changed, so a full copy is needed.
- Both arrays and strings store elements contiguously, so index-based 
access is constant time.
- No ordering or hashing assumed, so a linear scan is required in both 
cases.
