- One of most common apps. of a hash map/set is
determining if an elem. exists in O(1).
- Since an array needs O(n) to do this, using hash map/
set can improve time compl. of an alg. greatly, usually
from O(n^2) to O(n).

- E.g. (Two Sum): given an array of int nums and int target,
return indices of two numbers such that they add up to
target. You cannot use same index twice.

- To solve with brute force approach, simply check every
pair of nums and see if they add up to target.
- 1 for loop to iterate over array and at each iter., lock
in number num, then inner for loop looks for target - num
in array (because num + target - num = target).

- Alg. is slow because inner loop (which finds target - num
) costs O(n).
- Thus, time compl. is O(n^2).
- With hash map, can look for target - num in O(1), which
greatly improves time compl. to O(n).

- Can build hash map as we iterate along array, mapping each
val. to index.
- At each index i, where num = nums[i], we can check hash
map for target - num.
- Adding key value pairs and checking for target - num is
O(1), so time compl. improves to O(n).

- Seeking two nums that sum to target.
- Iterate over input for each element num, we see if this
elem. can be paired with another num to form target.
- If another elem target - num exists, then their sum
num + target - num = target is what we're looking for.
- So we iterate over input, put elems. in hash map.
- Then in future, can check if we've seen target - num
for each num in O(1).
- Problem wants us to return indices instead of nums,
so associate each num with its index.

- Time complexity is O(n) as hash map opers are O(1),
solution also uses O(n) space as number of keys hash
map stores scales linearly with input size.

- E.g. 2 (First Letter to Appear Twice): Given a string
s, return first character to appear twice, input guaranteed
to have duplicate character.

- Brute force would be to iterate along string, and for each
char c, iterate again up to c to see if there's any match:

class Solution:
    def repeatedCharacter(self, s: str) -> str:
        for i in range(len(s)):
            c = s[i]
            for j in range(i):
                if s[j] == c:
                    return c

        return ""

- Hash map sol. (repeated_char.py) improves time complexity
to O(n) as each loop iteration now runs in constant time.

- Space complexity is more interesting.
- Many will argue space complexity is O(1) because input can
only have chars from english alphabet, which is bounded by a 
constant (26).
- This is common with string probs. and technically correct.
- Should also note space complexity could be O(m), where m is
num. of allowable chars. in input.
