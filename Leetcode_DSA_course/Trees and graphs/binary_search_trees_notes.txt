- A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary
tree.
- A BST has the following property:
  - For each node, all values in its left subtree
  are less then the value in the node, and all vals.
  in its right subtree are greater than the val. in
  the node.
    - This property also implies that values in a
    BST must be unique.

- E.g. of a BST:
  -    23
       / \
      8   37
     /\   / \
    6 17 29 50
      /\
     9  20

- With a BST, opers. like searching, adding, removing can
be done in O(log n) time on avg., where n is num. of nodes
in the tree, using something called binary search.

- Let's say you have example tree, and you want to check if
val. 20 existed.
- Starting at root, we can see 23 > 20, which means we can
ignore right subtree, because every val. in subtree is also
going to be greater than 20.
- We start searching left subtree, at next step, 20 > 8, so
we can ignore left subtree and move to right.
- Next, 20 > 17 so we can ignore left subtree, finally we 
find 20 after moving right once more.

- This process has an avg. time complexity of O(log n), in
worst case scenario, lets say tree had no right children
and was just a straight line (basically a LL), time compl.
would be O(n).
  - In a BST, each comparison lets you discard about half
  of remaining elems., because you go left or right based
  on key.
  - A balanced BST with height h has approx. 2^h nodes = n.
  - Opers. (search/insert/delete) take time proportional to
  tree height:
    - Avg. time = O(height) = O(log n).

- An inorder DFS traversal priotizing left before right on
a BST will handle nodes in sorted order.
