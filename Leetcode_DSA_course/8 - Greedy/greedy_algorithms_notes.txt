- A greedy alg. is any alg. that makes the locally optimal
decision at every step.

- What makes a decision optimal?
- This'll depend on problem.
- E.g, if we're choosing some elems. and the prob. wants us to
find the max. sum of elements we take, then given a choice
between two nums., it's optimal to take the larger one.

- Second, what makes a decision local?
- A decision is local when it considers only available options
at the current step.
- It's based on info. it has at the time, and doesn't consider
any consequences that may happen in future from this decision.

- Most greedy probs. will be asking for max. or min. of something,
but not always.

- Imagine you're delivering pizzas and had to visit 5 diff.
houses.
- You're not good at planning, so you decide to start w/
nearest house.
- After completing that delivery, you again choose to go to
nearest of the 4 remaining houses, and so on until you finish
deliveries.
- Turns out if you went a different order there was a bridge
between two of the houses that could've potentially reduced
total travel time.
- At each step, you were greedy and only cared about
immeditae optimal choice, the choices were local because you
only considered the next house and ignored all future
decisions at the time of each decision.

- Alot of algs. involving heaps can be considered greedy.
- A heap gives us max. or min. elem., and generally greedy
approaches'll be choosing max/min elems. at each "step".
- Another thing to note is that in many greedy probs., you'll 
be sorting input at start.
- This is because we want to greedily choose max/min elems.
in many problems, and sorting input makes this convenient.

- Implementing a greedy alg. is usually easy, hard part is
realizing/proving greedy strat. works.
- In many probs., a greedy approach may lead to an answer
that's very close to correct answer, but still wrong.
- In context of LeetCode, we need fully correct sols., so using
greedy alg. when it doesn't work isn't good.
- But IRL, greedy algs. can give good approximations with
significantly less computation.
- A greedy approach to travelling salesman problem (TSP) yields
an answer that is only wrong by about 25%, with a time compl.
of O(n^2).
- Haven't found an exact sol. for it yet faster than O(2^n).

- "Greedy" isn't a data struct. and isn't any single alg.
either, therefore it's hard to become "good" at greedy algs,
and there isn't much to "learn" about it.
- Concept of "greedy" is extremely general and main thing to
practice is recognizing when it applies.
- Greedy algs. usually very efficient, so important to use
it to solve a problem. when you recognize greedy approach.
