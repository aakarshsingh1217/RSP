Basic Theorem

- Theorem 1: in a graph with no neg.-weigth cycles with N 
vertices, shortest path between any two vertices has at
most N - 1 edges.

-----------
Proof video
-----------

- Let's say we have regular (acyclic) graph.
- In a reg graph with N vertices at most N - 1 edges between 
any two vertices.

- For graphs with cycles, we can divide into 2 cases, one
with pos. weight cycle and one with neg. weight cycle.
- Positive weight cycle means in cycle, sum of weights of
edges is >= 0.
- In a neg. weight cycle, sum of weights of edges is < 0.
- In a cyclical graph, the num. edges between 2 vertices
will be greater than N - 1.
- Note Bellman Ford used to find shortest path.
- For a graph, we can check weight without using cycle and with
using cycle.
- Come to conclusion, for a normal graph AND for a graph with
a positive weight cycle, if we want to find shortest dist. b/w.
2 points, dist. will be at most N - 1 edges.
- If we find the shortest dist. between two points and end up
getting lower weights with N, N + 1 or N + 2 edges, then we
know graph has a neg. cycle, bc. as long as we keep going around
the pos. cycle, dist. will grow larger, so shortest dist. occurs
before going around cycle.

-------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem 2: In a “graph with negative weight cycles”, there is 
no shortest path.
-------------------------------------------------------------

- If sum of weights of cycle is less than 0, it's neg. weight
cycle.
- No matter pos. or neg. cycle graph, if we want to go from
A to B and there's a cycle, there'll be infinite num. paths.
- For bellman ford we're trying to find shortest dist. (min
sum of weights on a path).
- If we go through neg. cycle infinitely, path always gets
shorter, e.g. if sum of weights is -1, every time we go
around cycle, weight decrem. by 1.
- Therefore no shortest path b/w 2 points with neg. cycle.

-----------------------------------------------------------
How does the Bellman-Ford algorithm detect “negative weight 
cycles”?
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Bellman-Ford can detect whether there exists a negative
weight cycle in a graph.

- Detection method:
  - After relaxing each edge N - 1 times, perform the Nth
  relaxation.
  - According to BF alg., all dist. must be shortest after 
  relaxing each edge N - 1 times, however after Nth relax.,
  if there exists distances[u] + weight(u, v) < distances[v]
  for any edge(u, v), it means there's a shorter path, and
  at this point we can conclude there exists a neg. weight
  cycle.

*******************
Complexity Analysis
*******************

- V repr. num. vertices, E repr. num edges.
  - Time compl.: we iter. through all vertices, and in each
  iter., we'll perf. a relaxation oper. for each appropr.
  edge, therefore time compl. O(V * E).
  - Space compl.: O(V), use two arrs. length V, one to store
  shortest dist. from source vert. using at most K - 1
  edges, other to store shortest dist. from source vert.
  using at most k edges.

Improved Bellman-Ford Algorithm with Queue — SPFA Algorithm
***********************************************************

- If you choose order optimally, you can make BF more
efficient.

--------------
SPFA algorithm
--------------

- Improved var. of BF alg. uses a queue, improvement known as
"shortest path faster alg." (SPFA).

- Instead of choosing among any untraversed edges, as one
does by using BF, SPFA uses a queue to maintain next starting
vert. of the edge of the traversed.
- Only when shortest dist. of a vert. is relaxed and that the
vert. is not in "queue", we add vert. to the queue.
- We iter. the process until queue empty, atp. we have calc.
min. dist. from given vert. to any verts.
