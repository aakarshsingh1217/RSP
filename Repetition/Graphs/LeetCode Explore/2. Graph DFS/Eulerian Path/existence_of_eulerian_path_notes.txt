- Eulerian Path is a path of edges that visits all edges in
a graph exactly once.
- Choosing the wrong starting node can lead to having unreachable
edges.

- Eulerian circuit is an Eulerian path which starts and ends on
same vertex.
- Can begin circuit at any node.
- If graph doesn't contain Eulerian circuit, may not be able to
ret. to start node or won't be able to visit all edges of graph.

- What cond. required for valid Eulerian path/circuit?:
  - Depends on what kind of graph dealing with.
  - 4 flavors of Euler path we care about:
    - For Eul. circ. undir. graph, every vert. has even degree.
    - For Eul. path undir. graph, either every vert. has even
    deg. or exactly 2 verts. have odd deg.
      - If 2 verts. have odd deg., they symbolize start and
      end nodes.
    - For Eul. circuit dir. graph, every vert. has equal indeg.
    and outdeg.
    - For Eul. Path dir. graph, at most one vert. has
    (outdegree) - (indegree) = 1 and at most one vert.
    has (indegree) - (outdeg.) = 1 and all other verts. have
    equal in and out degs.

- Node degree in undir. graph has num. edges attached.
- In dir. graph, we have indegrees and outdegs.

- An additional req. when finding paths/circuits is that all
vertices with nonzero deg. need to belong to single connected
component.
