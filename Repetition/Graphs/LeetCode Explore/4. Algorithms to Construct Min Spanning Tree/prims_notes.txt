Explanation
***********

- Prim's alg stores 2 sets, one which stores vertices alr.
visited and one with non visited vertices.
- Each time select a vertex never visited before and put it in
visited set, then consider visited vertices as whole.
- Among all edges coming out of from the whole that connect with
the unvisited set, we'll select edge with min. weight and that
edge will be part of min. spanning tree.

- All we have to do is pick any arbitrary vertex from non-visited
set as starting point, among all edges coming out from this vert.,
select edge with min. weight and then found next vertex.
- Then consider the two visited vertices as a whole, and all
edges coming out from them to unvisited set, pick another edge
with min. weight and expand visited set again etc. etc.

Complexity analysis
*******************

- v repr. num. vertices, e repr. num. edges.
  - Time compl.: O(e * log v) for binary heap and O(e * v log v)
  for fib. heap.
  - For Binary heap:
    - We need O(v + e) time to traverse all vertices of graph,
    and we store in the heap all vertices that aren't yet incl.
    in min. spanning tree.
    - Extracting min. elem. and key decreasing opers. cost
    O(log v) time.
    - Therefore, overall time compl. is O(v + e) * O(log v)
    = O(E * log V).
  - Space compl.L O(v), need to store v vertices in our data
  struct.
