- 2 args., amt. = 5, numbers = [1, 2, 3] (e.g. 2 + 3 = 5 so true).

- E.g.: amt. = 4, nums = [1, 2, 3].
  - Smaller amts. easier to calc. than larger amts., try and shrink
  amt. as much as possible until you get to trivially small amt. for
  which ans. is known.
  - If you start with amt. 4, what options?
  - Can take first choice 1 and subtract it from 4:
    -          4
             / |\
            /  | \
           /   |  \
          /    |   \
         /  1  |  2 \  3
        /      |     \
       3       2      1
  - Starting to shrink problem size, inside parent and child nodes,
  we've listed amts. we're trying to break down and then nums. next
  to edges repr. the choice of nums. we choose.
  - Can break down further:
    -          4
             / |\
            /  | \
           /   |  \
          /    |   \
         /  1  |  2 \  3
        /      |     \
        3      2      1
      / | \   2/\ 1    \ 1
    1/ 2| 3\   0 1      0
    2  1  0       \
   /\   \          0
   1 0   0

  - Describing is decision tree for all options we can possibly make.
  - Solvable using recursion.
  - Base case is 0:
    - if amount == 0:
        return True
  - Given a parent node, if it receives true from any of its children,
  it'll also return true.
  - Above is brute force way to descr. ans. here, complexity:
    - Let a = amount and n = len. nums.
    - Time compl.: O(n^a) (exponential), n is base of exponent bc.
    given a node, it's going to give at most n children, a is exp.
    because height of tree is at worse going to be a.
    - Too large for large inputs.
    - Space compl.: O(a) based on height of tree (call stack).
  - Can make it better by noticing duplicate work such as subtree
  rooted in 2 or 1, so we're solving duplicate probs., instead
  should memoize ans. (store in cache so you can fetch later).
  - Memoized compl.:
    - a = amt., n = len. nums.
    - Removed exponential nature of problem, time compl. is
    O(a * n), no longer exponent, simply multipling them.
    - a still repr. num. levels in tree (height) and n repr.
    width of tree (for every level, have at most n nodes).
    - Still O(a) space compl. as stack frames for height of
    tree used, and memo is linear a.
