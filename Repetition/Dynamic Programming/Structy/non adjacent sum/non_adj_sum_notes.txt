- Take in arr. containing sum nums., and return max. sum of non
adj. sum in arr.
  - For [2, 4, 5, 12, 7], ans. is 16 bc. 4 + 12 = 16.

- E.g. with [2, 4, 5, 12, 7]:
  - Need to find way to come up with all possib. for nums. taken
  into sum and nums. excluded.
  - Let's make decision tree, first elem. could be 2, resulting
  elems. could 5, 12 and 7:
    -        2, 4, 5, 12, 7
             / 2          \ 
            /              \
        5, 12, 7       4, 5, 12, 7
          /  \             /  \
       5 /    \         4 /    \ 
        /      \         /      \
       7      12, 7     12, 7   5, 12, 7
               /  \
           12 /    \
             /      \
                     7            
  - Given any partic. arr., can either take the first elem. or
  not take the first elem. and that would decide what remaining
  elems. I could choose from, either slicing of one or 2 elems.
  from the front of my arr.
  - To implem. DP, notice any duplicate subtrees e.g. 5, 12, 7 and
  12, 7
  - Toward bottom of tree we'll have leaves that repr. empty arrs.
  which is good because as prob. size gets smaller we get smaller and
  smaller arr.
  - Base case is empty arr., empty arr. max sum = 0.
  - For leftmost 7 node, bubble up the 0 and add the edge that takes it 
  to 7 (to sum).

- Complexity:
  - n = len nums., brute force is exponential runtime of 
  O(2^n) and space O(n).
  - Time compl. is 2^n because for every node, it's going to give 
  at most 2 children.
    - Worst case from one level to next, double num. nodes.
  - Height of tree is N because in some scenarios could keep
  removing first elem. of arr. again and again meaning deepest
  recursion would require N stack frames in call stack.
  - Can optimize w/ dynamic prog. and memoization, which would
  lead to runtime O(n) and space compl. O(n).
