// as n grows, n^2 grows very fast and is very inefficient comapred to o(n), o(log n)
// and o(1), so rewrite code that's o(n^2) to o(n) which is a huge increase in efficiency

// o(n^2) is a loop within a loop, o(n) is proportional is always a straight line,
// o(log n), divide and conquer, o(1) is constant time.
