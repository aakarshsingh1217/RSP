- A binary search tree can become skewed (like a LL)
causing operations to degrade to O(n).
- AVL trees and Red-Black trees are self-balancing BSTs that
guarantee:
  - Tree height = O(log n).
  - Search/insert/delete = O(log n)

********
AVL Tree
********

- An AVL tree is a BST where:
  - For every node, |height(left) - height(right)| <= 1
  - Called the balance factor.

- How AVL maintains balance:
  - After every insertion or deletion:
    1. Update heights.
    2. Compute balance factor.
    3. If unbalanced, perform rotations.

- Why rotations exist:
  - Rotations restore balance while preserving BST order.
  - When balance factor is +- 2, we rotate.
- Right rotation (LL case)
  - When does this happen?
    - Left-Left (LL) imbalance.
    - A node is left-heavy.
    - Imbalance came from inserting into left subtree of child.
  - Shape before:
    - 
          z
         /   
        y    
       /
      x
      - balance(z) = +- 2
      - balance(y) >= 0
    - Right rotate at z.
  - Shape after:
    -   y
       / \
      x   z
  - Why it works:
    - y moves up 
    - z moves down to right
    - In-order traversal stays same.
  - Intuition:
    - Pull left child up.
- Left rotation (RR case)
  - RR imbalance.
  - Node is right heavy.
  - Insertion happened in right subtree of right child.
  - Shape before:
    -   z
        \
         y
          \
           x
  - Left rotate at z
  - Shape after:
    -   y
       / \
      z   x
    - y moves up.
    - z moves down to left
    - BST ordering preserved.
  - Intution:
    - Pull right child up.
