Singleton
*********

- Singleton ensures:
  - Only one instance of a class ever created.
  - All users of class share same instance.
- Used when you want global shared state, e.g.:
  - Database connection pool.

- Core idea (conceptually)
  1. First request -> creates object.
  2. Later requests -> return same object.

- Big-O Time Complexity:
  - Instant access: Config()
    - Pointer check.
    - O(1) time.
  - First creation:
    - One obj. alloc.
    - O(1) time.
  - Subsequent calls:
    - Return stored referece.
    - O(1) time.

*******
Factory
*******

- Factory encapsulates object creation so that:
  - Client code doesn't need to know which concrete
  class is being created.
  - You can add new types without changing client code.
  - Creation logic lives in one place:
  - Think: Given some input, give me right object.

- Factory design pattern is useful because (from e.g. implem.):
  - Add a new shape -> just add a class + one factory case.
  - Avoid if/else logic scattered everywhere.
  - Centralizes obj. creation

- O(1) time complexity for obj. creation, looking up which obj.
to instantiate and O(1) const. memory per object.
