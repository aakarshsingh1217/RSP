- More efficiently repr. sparse graphs by using linked lists
to store neighbours adjacent to each vertex.
- Adj lists require pointers.

- Adj. lists make it harder to verify whether a given edge
(i, j) is in G, since we must search through appropriate
list to find edge.
- However, suprisingly to design graph algs. that avoid
need for such queries.
- We sweep through all edges of graph in one pass via 
BFS or DFS.

- Use adj. lists as primary data struct to repr. graphs,
for each graph we keep count of num vertices, and assign
each vertex unique idenitification number from 1 to
nvertices.
- Repr. edge using arr. of linked lists.

- Time/space compl. of graph with adj. list.
  - Let V = num vertices
  - Let E = num edges
  - Let deg(v) = outdegree of vert. v 
  - Overall space compl. (adj. list):
    - Total space: O(V + E)
      - Edges arr.: O(V)
      - Degree arr: O(V)
      - One EdgeNode per edge -> O(E)
  - Init graph:
    - Time O(V) as it loops over all vertices to reset
    arrs.
  - Insert edge:
    - O(1) time as it inserts at head of LL.
  - Read graph:
    - O(V + E) time as O(V) initialisation and reading
    and inserting edges O(E).
  - Print graph:
    - O(V + E) time as outer loop visits all vertices
    and inner loop traverses all adjacency list.
