- Merge short is divide and conquer alg.
- Works by:
  1. Dividing array into two halves.
  2. Recursively sorting each half.
  3. Merging two sorted halves into one sorted arr.
- Base case is when subarray has one elem. (already sorted).
- Key oper. is merge, which combines two sorted lists in
linear time.
- Merge sort good for LL.
- For arrays, needs extra memory to merge safely.

*****************
How merging works
*****************

- Each half already sorted.
- Smallest remaining elem. must be at front of one of
two halves.
- Repeatedly take smaller front elem.
- Total comparisons <= n - 1 -> O(n).

****************************
Time complexity of mergesort
****************************

- Step 1: Num. recursion levels:
  - Each recursive call halves problem size.
  - Num. of times you can halve n until 1: log n 
- Step 2: Work per level:
  - At each level, all subarrays together contain n elems.
  - Merging across that level takes O(n) total.
- Step 3: Combine:
  - Time = (work per level) * (num. levels)
         = O(n) * O(log n) = O(n log n)
    - Tight bound.

- Space compl.:
  - Arrays:
    - Need auxiliary buffer to merge halves.
    - Extra space = O(n).
  - Recursion stack:
    - Depth = O(log n).
    - Stack space smaller than merge buffer.
  - Space compl. is O(n) as it dominates.
