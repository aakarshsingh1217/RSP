- Binary search efficiently finds a key in sorted arr.
by repeatedly halving search space.
- Each comparison elims. half of remaining elems.
- Variants of BS solve more probs.
  - Counting occurences by finding left/right boundaries.
  - One-sided binary search when arr. size is unknown.
  - Root finding (square roots) using internal halving.
- BS a core div. and conquer technique

***********************
How binary search works
***********************

1. Compare target with middle elem.
2. Discard half that can't contain ans.
3. Repeat until found or interval empty.

- Time compl. of binary search:
  - Start with n elems.
  - After 1 comparison -> n / 2.
  - After 2 comparisons -> n / 4.
  - After k comparisons -> n / 2^k
  - Stop when n/2^k = 1,
    k = log n.
- Time compl.:
  - Best case: O(1) (middle elem. matches)
  - Worst case: O(log n).
  - Avg. case: O(log n).

- Space compl. of binary search:
  - Recursive version:
    - Each recursive call uses stack space
    - Depth = num. halvings = O(log n)
  - Iterative version:
    - Uses constant vars. only.
    - Space: O(1).

- Binary search runs in O(log n) time because each comparison
cuts prob. size in half.
