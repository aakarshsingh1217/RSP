- If we replace underlying data struct. with a 
priority queue (heap or balanced BST), finding/removing 
min. elem. becomes fast.
- Heapsort = selection sort + right data struct. (heap).
- Heap is a complete bianry tree with a partial order.
  - Min-heap: parent <= children.
- Heaps stored implicitly in an array (no pointers):
  - parent at i.
  - children at 2i, 2i + 1.
- Heap opers.
  - insert -> bubble up.
  - extract_min -> bubble down.
- Heaps built:
  - Incrementally in O(n log n).
- Heapsort total time is O(n log n).

*************
Heapsort alg.
*************

- Build heap from input array.
- Repeatedly:
  - Extract min.
  - Place it into output arr.
- This is selection sort, but with heap instead of plain
array.

- Time compl.
  1. Heap height is log n as heap is complete binary
  tree.
  2. Build heap:
    - Incremental insertion:
      - n inserts * O(log n) -> O(n log n).
  3. Extract min (done n times):
    - Swap root with last elem. -> O(1).
    - Bubble down -> at most height of heap -> O(log n).
    - n extractions * O(log n) = O(n log n).
  - Final complexity: O(n log n).
