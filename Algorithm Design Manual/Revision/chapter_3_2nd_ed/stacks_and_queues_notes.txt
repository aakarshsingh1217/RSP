Stacks
******

- Support retrieval by last-in, first out (LIFO) order.
- Simple to implement and very efficient.
- Right DS to use when retrieval doesn't matter at all.
- Put and get opers. for stacks called push and pop:
  - Push(x, s): insert item x at top of stack X
  - Pop(s): ret. (and remove) top item of stack s.
- Big O time compl.
  - Push: O(1) amortized
    - Adds elem. to top, this is constant time because
    it's an append.
    - Occasionally underlying array resizes, but that cost
    is spread over many pushes.
  - Pop: O(1)
    - Removes top elem. Direct oper. on end of array.
  - Space: O(n)
    - Stack stores n elems.

******
Queues
******

- Support retrieval in first in, first out (FIFO) order.
- Even though FIFO minimizes max. time waiting, avg. time
waiting will be same because every item processed
exactly once, and total waiting time's same, just distributed
differently:
  - FIFO (queue): first item waits least, last item waits most.
  - LIFO (stack): last item waits least, first item waits most.

- Big O time compl.:
  - Enqueue: O(1) (append to end of deque)
  - Dequeue: O(1) (pop from front of deque).
  - Space compl.: O(n) for n elems. in queue.
  - Each oper. only touches one end of data struct.
  no shifting or traversal of elems required, storing n elems.
  requires linear space.
    - Underlying implementation of deque in Python is O(1)
    because it's implemented as a doubly linked list, so
    items.popleft() updates pointer to next node and reqs.
    no shifting or traversal.
