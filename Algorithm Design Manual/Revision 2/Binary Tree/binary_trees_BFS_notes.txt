- In BFS, we traverse all nodes at a given
depth before moving onto next depth.

***********************
When to use BFS vs DFS?
***********************

- With DFS, you could waste a lot of time
looking for a val.
- Let's say you had huge tree, and you were 
looking for a val. stored in root's right
child.
- If you do DFS prioritizing left before
right, you'll search entire left subtree,
which could be hundreds of thousands of
opers.
- Main disadvantage of BSF is that if 
node you're searching for is near bottom,
then you'll waste alot of time searching
through all levels to reach bottom.

----------------
Space complexity
----------------

- DFS uses space linear with height of tree
(max depth), whereas BFS uses space linear 
with level that has most nodes.
- E.g., in perfect binary tree, DFS uses
O(log n) space whereas BFS uses O(n).
  - Final level in perf. binary tree has
  n / 2 nodes, but tree only has depth of
  log n.

- However if you have lopsided tree (like 
straight line), BFS will have O(1) space
compl. while DFS has O(n) (lopsided tree
is edge case whereas more full tree is
expectation).

-------------------
Time complexity BFS
-------------------

- With an efficient queue, dequeue and enqueue
opers. are O(1), which means time complexity of
BFS is same as DFS.
- Main idea is we visit each node only once,
so time complexity is O(n * k), where n is total
num. nodes and k is amount of work at each node,
usually O(1).
