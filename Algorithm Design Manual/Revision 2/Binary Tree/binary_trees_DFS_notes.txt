- Start at root, and traverse by using child
pointers .left and .right.
- Binary trees can do DFS in 3 ways: preorder,
inorder and postorder.

***
DFS
***

- Depth of a node is dist. from root.

- In DFS, we prioritize by traversing as far
down tree as possible in one dir. (until
reaching leaf node) before considering
another dir.
- E.g., let's say we choose left as our
prio. dir.
- We move exclusively node.left until left
subtree fully explored, then explore right
subtree.

- Think of paths of a binary tree as
branches growing from root.
- DFS chooses a branch and goes as far down
as possible.
- Once it fully explores branch, backtracks
until it finds another unexplored branch.

- Because we need to backtrack up tree
after reaching end of a branch, DFS
typically implemented using recursion.

- DFS structure:
  1. Handle base cases, usually empty tree
  (node == null) is base case.
  2. Do some logic for curr. node.
  3. Recursively call on curr. node's children.
  4. Return answer.

- Name of each traversal described when curr.
node's logic is performed:
  - Pre -> before children.
  - In -> in middle of children.
  - Post -> after children.

*******************************************
Time and space complexity of tree questions
*******************************************

- Time complexity is almost always n, where n
is total num. nodes, because each node only
visited once, and at each node, O(1) work done.
  - If more than O(1) work done at each node,
  say O(k), then time compl. is O(n * k).

- For space compl., even if you're using
recursion, calls are still placed on call stack
which counts as extra space.
- Largest the stack will be at any time will
depend on tree.
  - For recursion, worst case is O(n) if tree's
  a straight line, if tree is complete (all
  nodes have 0 or 2 children and each level
  except last level is full), then space
  complexity is O(log n).
    - Complete tree no. nodes = 2^(h + 1) - 1.
    - n = 2^(h + 1) - 1
      h = log base 2 n.
    - DFS doesn't store all nodes, only stores:
      - Path from root.
      - Down to curr. node.
    - At any moment, deepest recursiong goes is
    tree's height, so max stack frames =
    height of tree.

******************************************************
One sentence summary of DFS contains (ret. true/false)
******************************************************

- When a recursive call finds the target and returns
True, that value propogates upward through call stack,
first becoming found_right or found_left in its
parent, and eventually causing all ancestor calls
to return True.
