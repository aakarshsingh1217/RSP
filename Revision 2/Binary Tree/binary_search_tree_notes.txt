- A BST has following property:
  - For each node, all vals. in left subtree
  are less than val. in node, and all vals.
  in right subtree are greater than val.
  in node.

- With a BST, opers. like searching, adding
and removing can be done in O(log n) time
on avg., where n is num. nodes in tree,
using binary search.
  - All BST opers. follow one root -> leaf
  path.
  - Cost is proportional to height of tree,
  h.
    - Time = Θ(h).
    - Space = Theta(h) (recursive).
  - Height of a balanced BST is log n,
  of a skewed BST is n.
    - This alone explains all complexities.
  - Search:
    - Best case target at root, time and space
    O(1).
    - Average case tree is roughly balanced and
    each comparison halves remaining search space,
    time and space O(log n).
      - n → n/2 → n/4 → ... → 1
      ⇒ number of steps ≈ log₂ n
    - Worst case tree's completely skewed, time
    and space O(n).
  - Insert:
    - What happens:
      - First, search for insertion position.
      - Then attach new node (constant work).
    - Best:
      - Insert as child of root, time and space
      O(1).
    - Average:
      - Balanced tree, time and space O(log n).
    - Worst:
      - Skewed tree, time and space O(n).
  - Delete:
    - What happens:
      - Search for node, possibly find successor/
      pred., rewire pointers.
    - Best:
      - Delete root with 0 or 1 child, time and
      space O(1)
    - Avg.:
      - Balanced tree, time and space O(log n).
    - Worst:
      - Skewed tree, time and space O(n).
  - One sentence:
    - BST operations take time propotional to
    tree height because each step discards half
    remaining search space in balanced tree,
    giving O(log n) time on avg, degrades to 
    O(n) when tree's skewed.

- When implementing BST delete, you need to
follow rule that all values in left subtree < N.val
and all vals. in right subtree > n.val.
- Smallest value in right subtree is greater than
deleted node and it's min. of right subtree,
therefore it's:
  - left subtree < successor < rest of right subtree.
