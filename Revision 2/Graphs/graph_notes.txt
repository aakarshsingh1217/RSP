************************************
Time and space complexities of graph
w/ adj. list and BFS and DFS on said
graph
************************************

- Adj lists
  - Space compl.: O(V + E):
    - edges array: O(V).
    - Each edge stored once (directed) or
    twice (undirected): O(E).
    - degree array: O(V).

- DFS on graph (adjacency list):
  - Time compl.: O(V + E):
    - Each vertex is added to seen once
    and visited once.
    - Each edge (EdgeNode) is traversed
    exactly once when scanning adjacency
    lists.
      - while p is not None:
            neighbour = p.y
            ...
            p = p.next
        - touches every adjacency list node
        once -> O(E) total.
  - Space complexity: O(V):
    - seen set: up to v vertices.
    - Recursion stack:
      - Worst case (deep DFS): O(V).
      - Balanced-ish graph, smaller but worst 
      case still O(V).

- BFS on graph:
  - Time compl.: O(V + E).
    - Each vertex enqueued once and dequeued
    once.
    - Each adj. list scanned once.
    - Each edge considered once.
    - Queue opers. O(1) amortized.
  - Space compl.: O(V):
    - seen set: O(V).
    - queue:
      - Worst case may hold all vertices in
      a layer.
      - In dense / wide graphs -> O(V).
