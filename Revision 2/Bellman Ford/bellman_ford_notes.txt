- Given a weighted graph V vertices and E edges,
and a source vertex src, find shortest path from
source vertex to all vertices in given graph.
- If a vertex cannot be reached from source vertex,
mark its distance as 10^8.

- If graph contains negative weight cycle, return
-1.

- Bellman ford is a single source shortest path
alg. Effectively works in cases of negative edges
and is able to detect negative cycles as well. It 
works on the principle of relaxation of edges.

- Time compl.: O(V * E * E), where V is num. vertices
and E is num. edges.
- Auxillary space: O(V).
