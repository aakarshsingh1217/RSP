Backtracking intro explanation pt. 1
************************************

Backtracking's a systematic way to explore
all possible configs of a problem without repeats
and without missing any.

You:

1. Build a solution step by step
2. At each step, try all valid choices
3. If a partial choice cannot possibly lead to a
full solution, stop early and go back (backtrack)

Commonly used for:

- permutations
- subsets
- etc.

Key idea: vector A = (a1, a2, ..., an)

Model solution as a vector

- a1 = first choice
- a2 = second choice
- ...
- an = final choice

Each ai chosen from finite set Si. Backtracking builds
this vect from left to right, checking validity as it goes.

How alg works:

at step k, we have a partial solution:

(a1, a2, ..., ak)

We:
- check if its a complete solution
- otherwise, try all possible vals for a subscr k+1
- recurse (depth first search)
This implicitly builds a tree of partial solutions, explored
using DFS.

Pseudocode:

Backtrack-DFS(A, k)

# If the current partial solution is a complete valid solution
if A = (a1, a2, ..., ak) is a solution then
    report it

else
    # Move to the next position in the solution vector
    k = k + 1

    # Compute the set of all possible values for ak
    compute Sk

    # While there are still choices left to try
    while Sk ≠ ∅ do

        # Pick one candidate value for position k
        ak = an element in Sk

        # Remove this value so it isn’t reused
        Sk = Sk − ak

        # Recursively try to extend this partial solution
        Backtrack-DFS(A, k)

Simple example: generatingn all binary strings of length
2

Let:
- a1, a2 be an element of {0, 1}

Start:
A = ()
k = 0

Choices:
a₁ = 0 → a₂ = 0 → solution: 00
                 → a₂ = 1 → solution: 01
a₁ = 1 → a₂ = 0 → solution: 10
                 → a₂ = 1 → solution: 11

Backtracking tree (conceptually)

        ()
       /  \
     (0)  (1)
     / \  / \
  (00)(01)(10)(11)

Each node partial sol, and DFS ensures:
- every config generated
- no duplicates
- no missed sols.

Summary
-------

Backtracking is a DFS over a tree of partial sols, where
we build sols incrementally and abandon paths that cannot
lead to valid complete answers.
